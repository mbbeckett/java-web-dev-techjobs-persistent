## General Information
TechJobs - Persistent allows users to enter and view new job openings in the tech industry. This project was built from an [MVC edition of TechJobs](https://github.com/mbbeckett/java-web-dev-techjobs-mvc). Originally, job data was loaded into the project from a csv file but in this edition, users can input data themselves. I implemented ORM functionality using Spring Data and Hibernate. The persistent classes are mapped to a mySQL database. Users have the option to search all entries, indiviudal jobs, or search/sort through all results.
